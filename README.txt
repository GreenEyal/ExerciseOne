This system receives a gzip-compressed base64-encoded XML file, and decompresses and decodes it so as to write it in
back to an output file in valid XML format.

To use this system, make sure your input file is located in the resources directory.
In the resources directory is also a config file with two settings:
'inputFile' - The name of the input file to be processed
'outputFile' - The name of the file to which the final xml content will be written to.
